# AngularApp
A sample Angular application with a Node.js backend to search and save movie and tv show interests

I developed this web app while pursuing my Masters at the University of Southern California. The purpose of the project was to gain expereince in developing a separate back end server (with Node.js in this case) and front end app (with Angular), with the ultimate goal of deploying the apps to the Google Cloud Platform.

The app allows users to search movies and tv shows, learn specific details about any of the individual search results, and store selected results to a watchlist in a persistant manner to later return to for further browsing.
